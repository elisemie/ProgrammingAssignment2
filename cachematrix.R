## Catching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute if repeatedly.
## below are a pair of functions tjat are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
inv <- NULL
set <- function(y) {
x <<- y
inv <<- NULL
}
get <- function() x
setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
getInverse <- function() inv
list(set = set,
     get = get,
     setInverse = setInverse,
     getInverse = getInverse)
}

## This function can compute the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated and the 
## matrax has not changed, then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getInverse()
        if (!is.null(inv)){
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
        }
        mat <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(mat, ...)
        x$setInverse(inv)
        inv
}
